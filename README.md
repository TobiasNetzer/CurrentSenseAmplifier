## High-Side current sense amplifier for precise current measurement (up to 100mA)
This high-side current sense amplifier is designed to enable accurate current measurement up to 100mA while maintaining a low burden voltage of 1mV/mA.
With a gain of 100, the amplifier produces an output voltage of 100mV/mA.

## Amplifier Accuracy

To test the accuracy of the current sense amplifier, various load currents are applied, and the amplifier’s output is compared to the corresponding load currents. The measurement error is then calculated and plotted as the deviation in percent from the actual value.

Across the tested current range form 5mA - 100mA, the error remained within ±0.2%.
